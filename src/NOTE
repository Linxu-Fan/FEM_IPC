For all energies:
1) The energy is a scalar. It is calculated
	a) per element for Elastic energy
	b) per vertex for InertiaEnergy
2) Its gradient wrt position (dE/dx) is a 3x1 vector;
3) Its hessian (d2E/dx1dx2) is a 3x3 matrix. 


TODO:
1) (0)edge-edge mollifier
2) (0)k_stiff value calculation
3) (1)Project Hessian into SPD
4) (2)Spatial hash to accelerate CCD

QUESTIONS:
1) Do we need to explicitly calculate the minimal distance between a point P and another points? P164 in IPC tutorial book.
